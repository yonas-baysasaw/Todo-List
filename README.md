# Simple Todo List Application

This is a simple web-based Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and persists the tasks in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **Edit Task**: Modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Persistence**: Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they remain even if you close and reopen the browser.
